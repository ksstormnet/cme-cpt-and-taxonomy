## Code Quality Requirements

When using AI assistants to generate or modify code:

- All code generated by AI assistants must meet our coding standards from the start
- AI should be instructed to follow linting rules proactively rather than retroactively
- AI should favor simplicity and clarity over cleverness
- All code must be validated with linters before committing
- AI-generated code must be reviewed for performance and security implications

## Prohibited Practices

### 1. Never use `--no-verify` flag

- AI should NEVER suggest using `--no-verify` to bypass hooks
- Always resolve linting issues rather than bypassing them
- When linting fails, fix the specific issues reported
- Pre-commit hooks are essential for maintaining code quality

### 2. Database Migration Restrictions

- Never implement non-existent migrations or propose empty migration files
- Don't discuss, document or suggest potential migrations unless explicitly asked
- Never include migration-related code or comments in responses
- Avoid terms like "you might need a migration" in explanations
- Consult team lead before any migration-related implementation

### 3. Prefer deletion over commenting

- Remove deprecated code entirely instead of commenting it out
- Don't add deprecation notices unless there's a transition plan
- Follow "clean as you go" - remove obsolete code immediately
- Commit messages should document what was removed and why

## Best Practices

### Giving Effective Instructions

When working with AI assistants:

1. **Be specific about standards**: Reference the coding standards document
2. **Provide project context**: Help the AI understand the project architecture
3. **Review outputs carefully**: Don't assume code is correct just because it looks good
4. **Provide feedback**: Tell the AI what it did well and what needs improvement

### Common Workflows

**Good Example**: Asking for help with specific tasks

```text
"Please help me implement a function that validates persona settings according to
our coding standards. Here's an example of similar functionality: [code snippet]"
```

**Bad Example**: Vague requests

```text
"Fix this code for me" (without specifying standards or what "fix" means)
```

## Review Process

All AI-generated code should go through the same review process as human-written code:

1. Verify it meets all coding standards
2. Run linters and fix any issues
3. Test the functionality thoroughly
4. Review for security implications
5. Check for performance considerations
6. Ensure proper documentation

By treating AI as a tool rather than a replacement for good development practices,
we can maintain code quality while benefiting from AI assistance.
